## Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game.

# Front-end
XML is used to develop the front-end. Repetitive UI components have been modularised by using styles.

# Back-end
The backend has been implemented by using Kotlin but since it is a game, I am trying to integrate the C/C++ code for the backend.
This would not only ensure that the functionalities of the app remain pristine since they are implemented using Kotlin but also,
we would be able to harness the power of C++ for this sort of game development.
